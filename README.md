I HAVE CREATED A AI VOICE ASSISTANT USING PYTHON.

Here's a sneak peek at its standout features:

1️⃣ Stay Ahead of the Curve: Get the latest news, check real-time stock prices, and find out the weather for any city, all through a natural chat with JARVIS.

2️⃣ Intelligent Note-Taking: Capture your thoughts on the fly, and watch as the AI assistant neatly organizes them into a handy text file. 🗒️💡

3️⃣ WhatsApp Harmony: Send messages seamlessly using WhatsApp Web, all without lifting a finger on your phone! 📱💬 Stay connected effortlessly.

4️⃣ Effortless Emailing: Send off emails in a breeze with your AI assistant. 📧✨

5️⃣ Entertainment at Your Fingertips: Open YouTube to play any topic you desire or explore the web by instructing your Jarvis to open specific websites.

This project is a testament to the power of OpenAI, and I'm eager to share how it can simplify your daily tasks and keep you informed. 💻🌐
